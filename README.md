This research examines how vervet monkeys adapt to urban environments by comparing their curiosity and exploration of new objects across different habitats. The study finds that captive monkeys, especially juvenile males, are more exploratory than their wild or semi-urban counterparts, likely due to positive interactions with humans and exposure to human-related food sources.
